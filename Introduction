Not long ago, generative arts and NFT took the world by storm. This is made possible after OpenAI significant progress in text-to-image generation.
Earlier this year, OpenAI announced DALL-E, a powerful text-to-image generator that works extremely well.
To illustrate how well DALL-E worked, these are DALL-E generated images with the text prompt of “a professional high quality illustration of a giraffe dragon chimera. a giraffe imitating a dragon. a giraffe made of dragon”.
The term "AI art" is used to describe creative works created with the help of computer programs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of computer science that aims to create software that can duplicate or imitate human intellect or brain functioning.

AI can create original works through machine learning and a variety of self-learning algorithms that extract information from data. The creation of AI art requires the input of both the human artist and the AI system; however, the degree of autonomy can vary widely, and the final product is highly dependent on the accuracy of the training data.
Artists use AI as a tool, collaborating with algorithms to establish rules that enable computers to examine hundreds of images to understand a specific creative process, such as a particular style or aesthetic.
Algorithms create original creations by generating unconventional geometrical, figurative, and patterned motifs. Machines are not the only thing AI artists work with; they also work with programmers, statisticians, computer scientists, and neuroscientists to create cutting-edge technology that challenges the limits of human ingenuity.
